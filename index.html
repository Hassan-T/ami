<a id="open-issues" class="anchor" href="#open-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open issues</h3>

<pre><code> Our main problem is  how the system will recognize and communicate with the acting device?
</code></pre>

<p>SPC will help the user to avoid a lot of dangerous habits and diseases .
The main thing we need to know  is to learn the simplest way that connect the system with its ambient , also between the system and the devices.
In the future we can add a lot of options that improve our project , like add some mechanical parts to the system , so the users with disabilities can have some benefits from our system, according to that we may need some helps from some mechanical students or researchers in the politecnico.</p>
